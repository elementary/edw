For years we dreamed about creating a conference for open source app developers. There are conferences for the people already on the inside‚Äîthe ones building platforms and big first-party apps, but we're bringing in those on the outside to include them in the process. This conference is our way of reaching out to app developers, sharing the knowledge we've all collected over the years, and providing a space to ask questions and provide feedback.

Welcome to the first **elementary Developer Weekend** üéâÔ∏è
