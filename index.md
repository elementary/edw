For years we've dreamed about creating a conference for open source app developers. There are conferences for the people already on the inside‚Äîthe ones building platforms and big first-party apps, but we're bringing in those on the outside to include them in the process. This conference is our way of reaching out to app developers, sharing the knowledge we've all collected over the years, and providing a space to ask questions and provide feedback.

We're excited to invite you to the first **elementary Developer Weekend** üéâÔ∏è

### Call for Papers

We need your help to make this conference a reality! **The call for papers is now open through April 20, 2021.** We are accepting both Ideas and Talks:

- **Ideas** are concepts for talks you'd like to hear or think would be beneficial to the community, but that you are not necessarily committed to giving yourself.

- **Talks** are proposals for presentations that you would like to give; these should be well thought out and you should be committed to preparing and recording a talk, as well as being present during the conference for any Q&A.

Topics should: 

- Be primarily educational
- Focus on design, engineering, or entrepreneurship
- Target an audience anywhere from those seeking to build their first app to experienced developers looking to take their apps to the next level

This is your opportunity to share your expertise with the community.
