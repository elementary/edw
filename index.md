For years we dreamed about creating a conference for open source app developers. There are conferences for the people already on the inside—the ones building platforms and big first-party apps, but we're bringing in those on the outside to include them in the process. This conference is our way of reaching out to app developers, sharing the knowledge we've all collected over the years, and providing a space to ask questions and provide feedback.

Welcome to the first **elementary Developer Weekend** 🎉️

edw was hosted live by [elementary] and [Jupiter Broadcasting] June 26–27 from 9 AM to 12 PM PDT (16:00–19:00 UTC) on the [elementary YouTube channel][youtube]. Each talk was pre-recorded with a live question and answer session following.
